X-line LINUX KERNEL DRIVER NOTES
================================
This document covers both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the device driver. 

On some Linux distributions (eg. Ubuntu) many of the commands listed
below will need to be preceeded by the 'sudo' command.

This driver supports the following Xline boards:

- X10
- X10i
- X15
- XSpin
- XLuminate
- XTopper


To compile a module for Linux under version 2.6, and later a full set of 
installed/configured kernel source files or a "source file header package" 
exactly matching your running kernel is needed. This Makefile only 
functions if it called through the kernel module build process.


To build the driver issue the following command from the driver directory:

	make -C /usr/src/linux SUBDIRS=`pwd` modules

	
If your target kernel source isn't in '/usr/src/linux' then the path will 
need changing.

When you are compiling on the target machine:

	make -C /usr/src/linux SUBDIRS=`pwd` modules_install

will copy the newly built xline.ko to the correct place under the 
/lib/modules directory. This process also automatically runs 'depmod' so Linux 
will know where to find the driver. Otherwise to install into the target 
filesystem mounted on the development machine run:

	make -C /usr/src/linux SUBDIRS=`pwd` INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/mnt/target-rootfs/ modules_install


The module can then be loaded on the target machine either by issuing the command:

	modprobe xline
or:

	insmod path to file/xline

Once the driver is loaded and a board plugged in, the board will appear under 
the '/dev' directory as '/dev/Xline_0' or '/dev/Xline_1', etc. depending on how 
many Xline boards are plugged in at the time.

To remove the driver:

	rmmod xline


Device Permissions:
New devices added under '/dev' directory are generally only available to the root user. 
To make the Xline device node available to everyone (rather than by 'root' user 
only), add the following rule to the udev rules file, typically: 
/etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules:

KERNEL=="Xline_?",SUBSYSTEM=="Xline",MODE="666" 
 
Save the file changes, then disconnect and reconnect the XLine board for the changes 
to take effect. 
 
‘50-udev.rules’ is a file intended for generic udev rules; note that the first two 
terms in the rule use double-equals (==) and the third term is a value assignment 
with single-equals (=); 666 grants Read/Write access to: 
Owner, Group and Global. 

If you wish to specify a group you can add ,GROUP="my_group_name" to the line.
